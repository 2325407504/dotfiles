Fahd Shariff's Dotfiles
=======================

I created this repository primarily to store my Bash profile because I hate logging on to a new machine and not having my familiar prompt and favourite aliases! Since then, I have also added configuration files for:

-   tmux
-   vim
-   ssh
-   grc
-   eclipse

Installation
------------

I don't have an installation script yet. Just download and extract to your `$HOME` directory. Remember to backup your files first. Alternatively, extract them to a temp directory, `diff` against your existing files and see if you are happy with the differences before replacing your files.

Main Features
-------------

### Bash Profile

My Bash profile has many useful aliases and functions; some invented, others discovered. I also have a powerful prompt. Here is a screenshot of my terminal running tmux:

![My Terminal][7]

I have written a series of blog posts describing my profile in detail.

-   [My Bash Profile - Part I][1]
-   [My Bash Profile - Part II: Aliases][2]
-   [My Bash Profile - Part III: Completions][3]
-   [My Bash Profile - Part IV: Functions][4]
-   [My Bash Profile - Part V: Prompt][5]
-   [My Bash Profile - Part VI: Inputrc][6]

### TMUX

[tmux][9] is great for managing multiple sessions. My `.tmux.conf` has a number of handy bindings to split windows, ssh to machines and open man pages. For more information on tmux take a look at [Managing Multiple Terminals with Tmux][11].

### SSH

My ssh config is set up to use [multiplexing][10] in order to speed up connections to the same server.

### Eclipse

I have some very useful [Eclipse templates][8] which help in writing Java boilerplate code very fast. To install my templates, open Eclipse and go to *Window > Preferences > Java > Editor > Templates*. Press the *Import* button to import my `templates.xml`.
